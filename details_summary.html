           <p class="sum"> Photography, at its core, is the art and science of capturing and preserving images by recording light, either electronically through a digital sensor or chemically through film. It's a visual medium with roots tracing back to the 1800s, enabling us to document moments, express creativity, and share stories. Essentially, photography is "drawing with light," a process where light, focused by a lens, interacts with a sensitive surface to create a lasting image. 
Here's a more detailed look:
The Essence of Photography:
It's about capturing light and translating it into a visual representation. This can be achieved through various methods, including: 
Digital Photography: Utilizing a digital sensor to record light information. 
Film Photography: Employing light-sensitive film to capture the image. 
Beyond the Technical:
While the technical aspects of photography involve understanding light, lenses, and exposure, it's also a powerful form of artistic expression. 
Applications:
Photography plays a vital role in numerous fields:
Art: As a creative outlet, allowing for unique perspectives and storytelling. 
Documentation: Capturing historical events, scientific data, and everyday life. 
Communication: Sharing information and ideas through visual means.</p>
